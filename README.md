# Internal Mark Calculator




## Features

Takes the marks scored in Model 1, Model 2, and Model 
3 exams as inputs, along with some extra criteria, and calculates 
the student's internal mark


## Reason For Development

  Many students passthe external exams 
but fail in internals. By knowing their internal marks before the
semester exam, students can understand how much they need to 
score in the external exam to pass the subject without any arrears. 

This website also provides the mark needed in the external exam, 
giving students a clear idea of the required score before attending 
the exam.
